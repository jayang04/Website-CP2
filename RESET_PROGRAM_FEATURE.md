# Reset Program Feature - Quick Reference

## What Was Added

A **"üîÑ Reset Program"** button in the InjuryRehabProgram header that allows users to:
- Clear their current rehabilitation program selection
- Reset all progress data
- Return to the program selection screen
- Choose a different injury type

## Location

The reset button appears in the **top-right corner** of the rehabilitation program page, next to the injury title.

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "üîÑ Reset Program"**
2. **Confirmation dialog appears**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Are you sure you want to reset your program? This will clear your current progress and return to program selection."
3. **If confirmed:**
   - Clears `localStorage` data for user's injury selection
   - Clears progress data (completed exercises, phase, etc.)
   - Resets component state
   - Shows program selection screen again
4. **User can select a new program** (ACL, MCL, Meniscus, Ankle Sprains, etc.)

## Use Cases

‚úÖ **Testing different programs** - Quickly switch between injury types  
‚úÖ **Wrong selection** - Fix if user selected wrong program initially  
‚úÖ **Starting over** - Reset progress and start fresh  
‚úÖ **Debugging** - Check which program configurations work correctly  

## Button Styling

- **Color**: Red (#ff6b6b) to indicate caution
- **Position**: Top-right corner (absolute positioning)
- **Hover effect**: Lighter red with slight lift animation
- **Icon**: üîÑ for easy identification

## Code Changes

### File Modified: `/src/pages/InjuryRehabProgram.tsx`

**Added Function:**
```typescript
const handleResetProgram = () => {
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    '‚ö†Ô∏è Are you sure you want to reset your program?'
  );
  
  if (confirmed) {
    // Clear localStorage
    localStorage.removeItem(`rehabmotion_user_injury_${userId}`);
    localStorage.removeItem(`rehabmotion_injury_progress_${userId}`);
    
    // Reset state
    setPlan(null);
    setProgress(null);
    setShowProgramSelection(true);
  }
};
```

**Added Button:**
- Positioned absolutely in top-right of header
- Red color scheme with hover effects
- Calls `handleResetProgram()` on click

## Testing Steps

1. Go to Rehabilitation Programs
2. Select any program (e.g., ACL Tear)
3. Complete some exercises (optional)
4. Click "üîÑ Reset Program" button
5. Confirm the dialog
6. Verify you're back at program selection screen
7. Select a different program
8. Verify it loads correctly

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental resets
- ‚úÖ Clear warning message about data loss

- ‚úÖ Does not affect dashboard or other user data

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
