---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
User completes exercise
  → handleToggleExercise sets lastCompletedExercise state
  → useEffect detects state change
  → cloudDashboardService.addActivity() adds to activity feed
  → cloudDashboardService.updateStats() updates completion count
  → onDashboardRefresh() triggers parent component refresh
  → Dashboard UI updates automatically
```

### State Management
- `lastCompletedExercise`: Tracks most recently completed exercise (id + name)
- `progress.completedExercises`: Array of all completed exercise IDs
- Dashboard state managed by parent (App.tsx)
- Refresh triggered via callback prop chain

### Cloud Sync
- Uses Firestore via cloudDashboardService
- Activities stored with timestamp for proper ordering
- Stats updated atomically
- Fallback to localStorage if cloud unavailable
