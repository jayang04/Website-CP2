## 🔍 Accessibility

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA
- ✅ Hover states on all interactive elements
- ✅ Disabled states clearly indicated
- ✅ Font sizes meet minimum readability (14px+)
- ✅ Touch targets meet 44px minimum on mobile

### Future Improvements
- 🔲 Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- 🔲 Keyboard navigation support
- 🔲 Focus indicators for keyboard users
- 🔲 Screen reader announcements for state changes
- 🔲 Reduced motion support for animations

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied
- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations
- Minimal use of heavy effects (shadows, gradients)
- Efficient flexbox and grid layouts
- Optimized re-renders with proper React patterns

### Potential Issues
- Shimmer animation may impact performance on low-end devices
- Multiple gradient backgrounds increase paint time
- Consider adding `will-change` property for frequently animated elements

---

## 🎨 Visual Consistency Checklist

- ✅ Consistent border radius across all components
- ✅ Unified color palette with gradient variations
- ✅ Consistent spacing using defined scale
- ✅ Typography hierarchy well-established
- ✅ Shadow levels consistent across similar elements
