# How to Upload Videos to Cloudinary - Step by Step

## Step 1: Go to Media Library

**Look at your left sidebar**, you should see:
- 🏠 Home
- 📁 Assets
- 🖼️ Image ← You're here now
- **🎥 Video ← CLICK THIS!**
- 🎬 MediaFlows

**Click on "Video"** in the left sidebar (not "Media Library" text, click the "Video" icon)

---

## Step 2: Once in Video Section

You'll see an **"Upload"** button (usually top right or center)

### If Upload Button is Disabled:

Try this alternative:

1. **Click "Assets"** in left sidebar (folder icon at top)
2. Then you'll see upload options
3. Or look for a **"+"** button

---

## Step 3: Alternative - Use Upload Widget

If you still can't upload:

### Go to Upload Page Directly:
1. Click this URL: https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-da7adf3ec50f669017951bbe3d7eba/media_library/folders/home
2. Or in top menu, look for "Upload" option

---

## Step 4: Drag and Drop

Once you find the upload area:
1. Open Finder on your Mac
2. Navigate to: `/Users/azx/Desktop/Website-CP2/public/exercise-demo-videos/`
3. **Drag the entire folder** into the Cloudinary window
4. Drop it in the upload area

---

## Alternative: Upload via API (Automated)

If the web interface is confusing, I can create an automatic upload script for you!

### What I Need:
1. Click **"View API Keys"** button (blue button on right side)
2. Copy your:
   - API Key
   - API Secret
3. Give them to me (in a private message if needed)
4. I'll create a script that uploads all videos automatically

---

## Quick Test:

Try clicking on:
- **"Video"** in the left sidebar (should be below "Image")
- **"Assets"** at the very top of left sidebar

One of these should give you upload options!
