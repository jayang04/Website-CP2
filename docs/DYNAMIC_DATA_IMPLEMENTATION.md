## Features Implemented

### âœ… Dashboard Features
- **Dynamic Stats**: Progress %, days active, exercises completed
- **Customizable Quick Actions**: Add/edit action cards
- **Live Program Progress**: Track current week and completion
- **Activity Timeline**: Auto-logs user actions with timestamps
- **Per-User Data**: Each user has isolated data storage

### âœ… Rehab Program Features
- **Exercise Management**: Add, edit, delete exercises
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark exercises as done/undone
- **Auto-Sync**: Changes reflect immediately on dashboard
- **Persistent Storage**: All data saved to localStorage
- **Program Separation**: Independent knee & ankle exercise lists

## How to Use

### For End Users

1. **Mark exercises as complete** in the Rehab Program
2. **Dashboard automatically updates** with your progress
3. **Activities log** shows your recent completions
4. **All data persists** across browser sessions

### For Developers

```typescript
// Import services
import { dashboardService, exerciseService } from './services/dataService';

// Update dashboard stats
dashboardService.updateStats(userId, {
  progressPercentage: 75,
  daysActive: 20,
  exercisesCompleted: 15
});

// Add activity
dashboardService.addActivity(userId, {
  type: 'completed',
  title: 'Completed workout',
  timestamp: new Date(),
  icon: 'âœ…'
});

// Manage exercises
const exercises = exerciseService.getExercises(userId, 'knee');
exerciseService.toggleExerciseCompletion(userId, 'knee', exerciseId);
```

## Optional Data Manager Tool

Add to any page for quick data management:

```tsx
import DataManager from '../components/DataManager';

// In your component
<DataManager userId={user.uid} />
```

This adds a floating button with options to:
- Add sample activities
- Update random stats
- Update program progress
- Export data as JSON
- Reset all data

## Data Storage

All data is stored in browser localStorage with keys:
- `rehabmotion_dashboard_data_{userId}`
- `rehabmotion_knee_exercises_{userId}`
- `rehabmotion_ankle_exercises_{userId}`

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Firebase Sync** - Sync localStorage to Firestore for cross-device access
2. **Progress Charts** - Visualize progress over time with Chart.js
3. **Export/Import** - Backup and restore data
4. **Share with Therapist** - Generate shareable progress reports
5. **Exercise History** - Track completion dates and frequency
6. **Pain Tracking** - Log and monitor pain levels
7. **Custom Programs** - Create personalized rehab programs
8. **Reminders** - Set exercise reminders
9. **Photos/Videos** - Upload form check videos
10. **Goals & Milestones** - Set and track recovery goals

### Quick Improvements

1. **Add more default exercises** - Expand the exercise library
2. **Add exercise videos** - Link to demonstration videos
3. **Add phases** - Implement phase progression logic
4. **Add weekly summaries** - Generate progress reports
5. **Add calendar view** - Visual exercise tracking

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Log in to the app
2. Visit Dashboard - should show zero stats initially
3. Go to Rehab Program
4. Select Knee or Ankle program
5. Mark some exercises as complete
6. Return to Dashboard
7. Verify stats updated
8. Check Recent Activities section
