## Common Exercise Types

### Mobility Exercises

- Heel slides
- Range of motion work

### Strengthening Exercises
- Quad sets
- Straight leg raises
- Calf raises
- Hip strengthening

### Balance & Proprioception
- Single-leg balance
- Clock reaches
- Stability work

### Functional Training
- Squats (various depths)
- Lunges
- Step-ups
- Hopping and jumping

### Advanced/Sport-Specific
- Box jumps
- Agility drills
- Figure 8s
- Plyometrics

## General Rehabilitation Principles

### Do's (Common Across All Injuries)
‚úÖ Follow PT instructions exactly  
‚úÖ Ice after exercises (15-20 min)  
‚úÖ Progress gradually through phases  
‚úÖ Communicate pain levels to PT  
‚úÖ Stay consistent with exercises  
‚úÖ Listen to your body  

### Don'ts (Common Across All Injuries)
‚ùå Don't skip strengthening exercises  
‚ùå Don't ignore pain signals  
‚ùå Don't return to sports too early  
‚ùå Don't compare your progress to others  
‚ùå Don't stop exercises after feeling better  

### When to See Doctor (Red Flags)
üö® Sudden increase in pain or swelling  
ÔøΩÔøΩ Joint giving way unexpectedly  
üö® Loss of range of motion  
üö® Unable to bear weight  
üö® Severe pain not controlled by medication  
üö® Signs of infection  

## Data Structure

All rehab plans are stored in `/src/data/injuryPlans.ts`

```typescript
export const REHAB_PLANS: Partial<Record<InjuryType, InjuryRehabPlan>> = {
  'acl-tear': ACL_REHAB_PLAN,
  'mcl-tear': MCL_REHAB_PLAN,
  'meniscus-tear': MENISCUS_REHAB_PLAN,
  'ankle-sprain': LATERAL_ANKLE_SPRAIN_PLAN,
  'medial-ankle-sprain': MEDIAL_ANKLE_SPRAIN_PLAN,
  'high-ankle-sprain': HIGH_ANKLE_SPRAIN_PLAN,
};
```

## Adding New Injuries

To add a new injury type:

1. Define injury info in `INJURIES` object
2. Create rehab plan with phases
3. Add exercises to each phase
4. Include do's, don'ts, and warnings
5. Add to `REHAB_PLANS` export
6. Update TypeScript types if needed
