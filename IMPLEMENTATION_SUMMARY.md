# Angle Detection Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Exercise Angle Configuration System**
Created a comprehensive configuration database (`src/data/exerciseAngleConfig.ts`) that maps **15 different exercises** to their angle requirements:

**Knee Exercises (8):**
- Heel Slide
- Short Arc Quad
- Straight Leg Raise
- Bridges/Glute Bridge
- Mini Squats
- Single-Leg Squat
- Forward Lunge
- Lateral Step-Up

**Ankle Exercises (4):**
- Ankle Pumps
- Calf Raise
- Heel Raise - Off Step
- Ankle Dorsiflexion Mobility

**Balance Exercises (1):**
- Single-Leg Balance

**Hip Exercises (2):**
- Hip Abduction/Banded Hip Abduction
- Hip Flexion with Straight Leg Raise

### 2. **Real-Time Angle Tracking Component**
Created `ExerciseAngleTracker.tsx` with:
- ✅ Live camera feed with pose detection
- ✅ Real-time angle measurement display
- ✅ Automatic rep counting (13 exercises)
- ✅ Color-coded feedback (green = good form, red = needs adjustment)
- ✅ Audio cues for completed reps
- ✅ Exercise-specific instructions
- ✅ Session tracking (reps & duration)

### 3. **Integration with Injury Rehab Program**
Updated `InjuryRehabProgram.tsx` to:
- ✅ Show **🤖 AI Form Check** button on supported exercises
- ✅ Open full-screen angle detection modal
- ✅ Seamlessly integrate with existing UI
- ✅ Auto-detect which exercises need angle tracking

### 4. **Features Included**
- **Smart Rep Counting**: Automatically detects and counts reps based on angle thresholds
- **Form Validation**: Real-time feedback if angles are too shallow/deep
- **Multi-Joint Tracking**: Can track knee, hip, and ankle angles simultaneously
- **Camera Guidance**: Tells user best camera position (side/front view)
- **Range Indicators**: Visual display of whether angles are in target range
- **Session Summary**: Shows total reps and duration on completion

## 🎯 How Users Access It

1. Go to their injury rehabilitation program
2. Select any phase
3. Find exercises with the **🤖 AI Form Check** button (15 exercises total)
4. Click to open the angle detection interface
5. Position camera and start tracking
6. Get instant feedback as they perform the exercise
7. System automatically counts reps and validates form

## 📊 Exercise Coverage

Out of all exercises in the system:
- **15 exercises** now have full AI angle detection
- **13 exercises** have automatic rep counting
- **All ankle/knee/hip exercises** that benefit from angle tracking are covered
- **More can be easily added** using the configuration system

## 📱 User Experience Flow

1. **Discovery**: User sees 🤖 AI Form Check button on exercise card
2. **Launch**: Clicks button → Full-screen modal opens
3. **Setup**: 
   - Camera permission requested
   - Instructions shown (camera angle, distance, etc.)
   - Shows which angles will be tracked
4. **Tracking**:
   - Click "Start Tracking"
   - Real-time angle measurements displayed
   - Color feedback (green/red)
   - Rep counter increments automatically
   - Audio ping on each rep
5. **Completion**:
   - Click "Stop & Save"
   - Shows final rep count and duration
   - Can save to progress log

## 🎨 UI Elements

- **Exercise Info Card**: Shows exercise name, camera position, target angles
- **Rep Counter**: Large display of current rep count
- **Live Feedback Panel**: Real-time form guidance
- **Angle Displays**: Color-coded boxes showing current angles
- **Control Buttons**: Start/Stop tracking, Close modal
- **Camera Feed**: Live video with pose skeleton overlay

## 📝 Configuration Example

Each exercise has a config like:
```typescript
'heel-slide': {
  requiresAngleDetection: true,
  cameraAngle: 'side',
  angleRequirements: [
    {
      joint: 'knee',
      minAngle: 90,
      maxAngle: 145,
      targetAngle: 120,
      description: 'Knee should bend between 90-145°'
    }
  ],
  repCounting: {
    startCondition: { angleThreshold: 160, direction: 'above' },
    endCondition: { angleThreshold: 120, direction: 'below' }
  },
  feedback: {
    good: '✓ Great knee flexion!',
    tooShallow: '↓ Try to bend deeper',
    tooDeep: '↑ Don\'t bend too far'
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Ready to Use

Everything is implemented and ready for users to try! The system will:
- Automatically show the AI Form Check button on supported exercises
- Provide real-time angle tracking and feedback
- Count reps automatically
- Help users perform exercises with proper form
