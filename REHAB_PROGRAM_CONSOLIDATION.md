# Rehab Program Consolidation - Summary

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Consolidated Both Rehab Programs into One

I've successfully moved the **RehabProgram** design and functionality into **InjuryRehabProgram**, creating a unified rehabilitation program experience.

## What Changed

### 1. **InjuryRehabProgram.tsx** - Enhanced with Program Selection
- ‚úÖ Added beautiful program selection screen (from RehabProgram)
- ‚úÖ Users now see cards to choose between:
  - **Knee Injuries**: ACL, MCL, Meniscus Tear
  - **Ankle Injuries**: Lateral Sprain, Medial Sprain, High Ankle Sprain
- ‚úÖ Imported `RehabProgram.css` for the card design
- ‚úÖ Added `showProgramSelection` state to manage selection flow
- ‚úÖ Added `handleSelectProgram()` function to set injury type
- ‚úÖ Automatically shows selection screen if no program is selected

### 2. **App.tsx** - Updated Routing
- ‚úÖ Removed import for `RehabProgram`
- ‚úÖ Changed `rehab-program` route to use `InjuryRehabProgram` instead
- ‚úÖ Now passes `userId` and `onBack` props correctly

### 3. **RehabProgram.tsx** - Can Be Removed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This file is **no longer used** and can be safely deleted
- The "Rehabilitation Programs" quick action now opens `InjuryRehabProgram`

## User Flow

### Before:
1. User clicks "Rehabilitation Programs" ‚Üí Opens generic `RehabProgram`
2. User clicks "Create Personalized Plan" ‚Üí Goes to `InjurySelection` ‚Üí Opens `InjuryRehabProgram`

### After:
1. User clicks "Rehabilitation Programs" ‚Üí Opens `InjuryRehabProgram` with program selection
2. User selects specific injury (ACL, MCL, Ankle Sprain, etc.)
3. User sees their personalized rehabilitation plan
4. "Create Personalized Plan" still works the same (smart intake form)

## Design Features Carried Over

‚úÖ **Beautiful card-based selection** with hover effects  
‚úÖ **Knee and Ankle program cards** with proper icons  
‚úÖ **Smooth transitions and shadows**  
‚úÖ **Responsive grid layout**  
‚úÖ **Back button** to return to dashboard  

## Benefits

1. **Single unified program** - No confusion about which to use
2. **Better UX** - Clear injury-specific program selection
3. **Consistent design** - Same look and feel throughout
4. **Easier maintenance** - One codebase instead of two
5. **All features intact** - Live form tracker, video demos, progress tracking all work

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "Rehabilitation Programs" from dashboard
- [ ] See program selection cards for Knee and Ankle
- [ ] Select ACL Tear - verify it loads the ACL program
- [ ] Select Ankle Sprain - verify it loads the ankle program
- [ ] Complete an exercise - verify it marks as complete
- [ ] Use Live Form Tracker - verify rep counting works
- [ ] Navigate back to dashboard - verify back button works

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Delete RehabProgram.tsx** if you don't need it anymore
2. **Update quick actions** to reflect the unified program
3. **Test all injury types** to ensure they load correctly
